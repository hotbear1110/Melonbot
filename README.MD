# Twitch bot using NODE.JS

As always, don't use it. It sucks.

## Setup

1. Create a MYSQl server. And a database thingy inside it.
2. npm install
3. npm run build
4. Copy from [config_example.js](credentials/config_example.js) over to a [config.js](credentials/config.js) file with your credentials.
5. npm run start
